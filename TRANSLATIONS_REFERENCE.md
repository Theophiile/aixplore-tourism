### Hero
- Title: **Aixplore Tourism**
- Tagline: *Between lake and mountains, an invitation to feel*

### Introduction
Here, everything begins with a breath.  
The wind over Lake Bourget, the forests of Revard, the voice that tells Savoie differently.

Aixplore Tourism was born from a deep love for this singular territory, where water, stone and light unite in perfect harmony.

We offer intimate and passionately guided excursions, so that each visitor leaves with more than a memory: an emotion.

### The Aixplore Spirit 🌿
We believe that exploring means taking the time to look, listen and feel.

Our excursions blend history, nature, culture and conviviality — always in a simple and sincere atmosphere.

Each tour is designed to tell the story of Savoie through its landscapes, flavors, faces and legends.

> "I don't seek to impress, but to inspire wonder. What I love is seeing people stop, smile, and let themselves be surprised."  
> — Anaïs Husson, founder and guide of Aixplore Tourism

### A Guide, A Voice, A Passion 🌸
Trained in cultural mediation and holding a mountain guide certificate, Anaïs Husson created Aixplore to share what she loves most: the beauty of small details.

A ray of sunlight on the Gorges du Sierroz, the scent of pines at the summit of Revard, the voice of a local remembering a story from long ago…

Curious, smiling, and deeply attached to her region, Anaïs loves to reveal Savoie differently, off the beaten path.

She doesn't just tell stories: she listens, exchanges, advises, gets to know her visitors and shares all her best local addresses to extend the discovery.

> "I'm not just the guide who explains and leaves. I'm the one who lives the moment with you."

Through her humor, her sense of connection and her poetic gaze on landscapes, Anaïs brings a unique soul to each excursion — made of nature, culture and real encounters.

### Human-Sized Experiences 🕊
Aixplore Tourism favors small groups — **up to 8 people** — to offer an atmosphere of trust and exchange.

Each visit takes place in **French or English**, respecting the place and those who inhabit it.

Our tours favor local discovery, regional gastronomy, and a gentle form of tourism, sustainable and respectful.

### Our Values 💫
- **Authenticity**: Speaking true, living true
- **Wonder**: Offering suspended, simple and precious moments
- **Transmission**: Sharing Savoie's cultural and natural wealth
- **Respect**: Of nature, of rhythm, of emotions

### A Human Adventure 🌍
Since its creation, Aixplore Tourism has welcomed travelers from all over the world.

English, Canadians, Germans, Australians, Swedes, Thais, Americans, Chileans, Brazilians, Chadians, French…

All leave with the same feeling: having lived a sincere interlude, between discovery and gentleness.

> "There is no greater reward than hearing a visitor say: I felt good here."

## Wellness Retreats (Retraites bien-être)

### Hero
- Title: **Mountain Wellness Retreats**
- Tagline: *Reconnect with the essential, with nature and with yourself*

### Introduction - A Pause to Find Yourself 🌿
Four retreats, four privileged moments to slow down, breathe and rediscover the simplicity of a natural rhythm.

Each stay is a bubble out of time, blending gentle body practices, energy healing, meditative walks and introspection.

Led by Anaïs, Isée and Marie, these retreats are an invitation to relearn how to listen to yourself, free your mind and soothe your body.

Each edition has its own theme — fasting, full moon, feminine, rebirth — but all share the same intention: **to free yourself, lighten up and reconnect with yourself.**

### Why a Gentle Ketogenic Diet? 🍲
We cannot soothe the spirit without caring for the body.

During retreats, we adopt a gentle ketogenic diet, designed to rebalance energies and promote mental clarity.

The principle: greatly reduce sugars and increase good fats to allow the body to enter a state of ketosis, where it draws energy from fats rather than glucose.

Result: **a clearer mind, stable energy, true recentering.**

**What you'll find on your plate:** 🌿
- Quality meats and fish
- Eggs, cheese, cream and full-fat yogurts
- Nuts (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts...)
- Low-carb vegetables (zucchini, broccoli, spinach...)
- Low-sugar fruits (berries, lemon, avocado...)

Starches, legumes, sweet fruits and glucose-based products are temporarily set aside: no more sugar in coffee and evening treats.

It's not a constraint, but a return to the essential: offering the body the peace it deserves so that the mind can also regenerate.

### Why Disconnect from Phones? 📵
Because there is no full presence with eyes on a screen.

Each retreat includes **complete disconnection from 9am to 8pm**: no phone, no screen, no notifications.

This voluntary break helps you rediscover presence, concentration, listening quality and true serenity.

Screens fragment our attention, fuel stress and prevent full relaxation.

Here, you'll learn to breathe without scrolling, to walk without taking photos, to feel without screens.

> "When you unplug from the world, you plug back into yourself."

(Phones remain accessible in the evening to notify loved ones if needed.)

### Practical Information 💫
- **Audience**: Adults – beginners or experienced in fasting
- **Type of fast**: Gentle ketogenic: herbal teas, broths, MCT oils, low-carb vegetables, proteins and good fats
- **Location**: Chalet or gîte in Savoie – Bauges, Revard or Lake Bourget area
- **Group size**: 8 to 10 participants maximum
- **Total disconnection**: No phone or screen from 9am to 8pm
- **What if it rains?**: Nothing is canceled, everything transforms. Rain purifies, wind liberates, earth anchors.
- **Reading**: Books are welcome during quiet times.
